# NNPP
This is a programming project for Neurocognitive Methods and Programming (SoSe 2020).

This is a Neural Network Programming Project (NNPP) module for Neurocognitive Methods and Programming (SoSe 2020).
This module provides classes for preprocessing and multi-, and binary classification using simple neural network
based on the "Haxby dataset" <http://data.pymvpa.org/datasets/haxby2001/> with .csv labels.

Those are required to run this module:
    - python : 3.6.10  
    - nibabel : 3.1.1  
    - nipype : 1.6.0 dev0  
    - nilearn : 0.6.2  
    - pandas : 1.0.5  
    - matplotlib : 3.2.2  
    - tensorflow : 1.13.1  
    - keras : 2.2.4  
    - jupyter notebook : 6.0.3  

And "You must install FSL to work with the nipype in this module".

This was tested on the docker "jihoonkim2100/nnpp" <https://hub.docker.com/r/jihoonkim2100/nnpp> environment
which leverage tensorflow and keras based on "nipype/nipype":
    - docker version : 19.03.1  
    - docker image OS : Debian GNU/Linux 9  
    - host OS : Windows 10 Home  

Belows are the reference for this project:   
    - scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>  
    - nilearn <https://nilearn.github.io/index.html>  
    - nipype <https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>
